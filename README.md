# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running the Application

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. In the project directory, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
   `npm install`

2. After the dependencies are installed, start the application by running the command:
   `npm start`

This command runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will automatically reload if you make any changes to the source code. Additionally, any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

### `Future upgrades`

The following upgrades are planned for the future:

1. Sort the folder/file list alphabetically.
2. Implement drag and drop functionality to enable users to change the position of files and folders.
3. Add a file viewer on the right side to provide a preview or detailed information about selected files.
